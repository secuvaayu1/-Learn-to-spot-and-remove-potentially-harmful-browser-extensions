🔍 Task 7: Identifying and Removing Suspicious Browser Extensions

Author: Adavirao V K

Category: Cybersecurity / Browser Security

🛠 Tools Used

Google Chrome (latest version)

Chrome Web Store for review and update checks

OS tools for screenshots and note-taking

📍 Step 1 — Accessing the Extension Manager

In Chrome, I accessed the extensions list via:
chrome://extensions/
This displayed all active and inactive extensions installed in my browser.

🔎 Step 2 — Reviewing Installed Extensions

I reviewed each extension by checking:

Permissions requested

Developer details

Reviews and ratings on the Chrome Web Store

Last update date

One extension stood out:

SEO Tool – Broken & Redirected Link Finder

Permissions: “Read and change all your data on all websites” (very broad)

Access to file URLs

Allowed in Incognito mode

Last updated a while ago, with mixed user reviews

⚖ Step 3 — Decision and Action

Since this extension was not essential to my daily workflow and had broad permissions, I removed it.

Clicked Remove in Chrome’s extension manager

Disabled “Allow in Incognito” for other extensions where unnecessary

Restarted Chrome to apply changes

📈 Step 4 — Post-Cleanup Observations

After removal:

Browser startup was slightly faster

Fewer background processes in Chrome Task Manager

Improved peace of mind knowing only trusted extensions remain

🚨 Potential Risks of Malicious Extensions

Tracking browsing activity

Stealing login credentials

Injecting ads or malicious scripts into web pages

Running hidden crypto-mining operations

Final Table of Changes
Extension Name	Status	Reason for Action
SEO Tool – Broken & Redirected Link Finder	Removed	Broad permissions, not actively used
Others	Kept	Trusted and essential
💡 Key Takeaways

Install extensions only from trusted sources.

Review permissions before installation.

Perform regular extension audits to maintain browser security.
